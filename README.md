# hello-world
My place to learn, test and create.

I am wanting to learn to create using various languages. I have some experience with VB, JS, HTML, CSS, VBS, VBA. So lots of Visual Basic, but I would like to branch out and learn C/C++, C#, Java and other languages that I am not familiar with. My goal is to learn enough to code full time either as freelance or for a company. I am just starting out, but I have a desire to learn and grow.
